explanation of controlled inputs and validation logic for your documentation: 

In React, controlled components are form inputs whose values are controlled by React state. This means that every input field, like name, email, and course, has a corresponding state variable that holds its current value. As the user types into these fields, the onChange event updates the state, ensuring that the displayed value in the input is always in sync with the component’s state. This approach allows React to have full control over the form data, making it easier to manage and validate. In our form, basic validation is implemented inside the form’s submit handler, where it checks if any of the input fields are empty. If any field is left blank, an alert message is shown to the user saying "All fields are required." If all fields are filled, the form values are printed to the console, and the input fields are reset by clearing the state values. This controlled input mechanism ensures data consistency and makes form validation simple and reliable.
